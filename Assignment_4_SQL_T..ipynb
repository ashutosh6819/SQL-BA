    "QUE 1. Explain how SQL Query keyword statements are executed in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - The SQL order of execution defines the order in which the clauses of a query are evaluated. Some of the most common query challenges people run into could be easily avoided with a clearer understanding of the SQL order of execution, sometimes called the SQL order of operations\n",
    "\n",
    "QUE 2. Explain the advantages of stored procedures and their syntax in relation to recompiling stored procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - Advantages :\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Higher Productivity – Since the same piece of code is used again and again so, it results in higher productivity.\n",
    "    2. Ease of Use – To create a stored procedure, one can use any Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Then, they can be deployed on any tier of network architecture.\n",
    "    3. Scalability – Stored procedures increase scalability by isolating application processing on the server.\n",
    "    4. Maintainability – Maintaining a procedure on a server is much easier then maintaining copies on various client machines, this is because scripts are in one location.\n",
    "    5. Security – Access to the Oracle data can be restricted by allowing users to manipulate the data only through stored procedures that execute with their definer’s privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "QUE 3. Give an example of the derived table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - A derived table is an expression that generates a table within the scope of a query FROM clause. For example select first_name as worker_table from worker_table \n",
    "\n",
    "QUE 4. What is the database's trigger? Explain the different forms of triggers that can be found in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - A database trigger is procedural code that is automatically executed in response to certain events on a particular table or view in a database. ... Triggers can also be used to log historical data, for example to keep track of employees' previous salaries.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In SQL Server, we have 3 groups of triggers:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - DML (data manipulation language) triggers – We’ve already mentioned them, and they react to DML commands. These are – INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - DDL (data definition language) triggers – As expected, triggers of this type shall react to DDL commands like – CREATE, ALTER, and DROP\n",
    " \n",
    "    - Logon triggers – The name says it all. This type reacts to LOGON events\n",
    "\n",
    "QUE 5. What are the benefits and drawbacks of triggers?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer -\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Benefits - \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Triggers are easy to code. The fact that they are coded like stored procedures which makes getting started with triggers easy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - You can call stored procedures and functions from inside a trigger.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Triggers can be nested to up to 32 levels. A trigger is considered to be nested when it performs an action that fires another trigger.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Drawbacks - \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If there are many nested triggers it could get very hard to debug and troubleshoot, which consumes development time and resources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Recursive triggers are even harder to debug than nested triggers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "QUE 6. Create a stored procedure to call other stored procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - create procedure Sp_insert  \n",
    "    (  \n",
    "    ID int,  \n",
    "    TempName varchar(max) \n",
    "    )\n",
    "    as \n",
    "    begin  \n",
    "    Declare SampleTable Table(id int, Name varchar(max))  \n",
    "    Insert into SampleTable(id,Name)values(ID,TempName)  \n",
    "    select*from SampleTable  \n",
    "    end\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
